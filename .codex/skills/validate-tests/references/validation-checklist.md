# Validation Checklist

- Read `problems/<problem>/checkpoint_N.md` and record all MUST/SHALL rules.
- Note inputs/outputs, formats, ordering, and error handling requirements.
- List each test and its assertions (including fixture/setup assumptions).
- Map every assertion to a specific spec clause.
- Flag assertions with no spec clause as out-of-scope assumptions.
- Flag contradictions between test expectations and spec text.
- Check every spec requirement has at least one test.
- Mark ambiguous spec wording where tests assume a specific behavior.
