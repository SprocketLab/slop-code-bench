You are an expert programmer and need to implement a task.
{% if not is_continuation -%}
Use a virtual environment and ensure that a `requirements.txt` is present with any dependencies you need to solve the problem.
{% else -%}
Keep using the same virtual environment you started with, update `requirements.txt` with any new dependencies you need.
{% endif -%}

Here are the steps you should always follow:
1. Before coding plan out what you need to implement.
2. Write the simple solution first.
3. Ensure it is 100% correct and you have covered all edge cases.
4. Refactor to ensure the code is high quality.

Your task is:
{{ spec.strip() }}
