Implement a program that 100% solves the specification. That is all you need to do.
{% if not is_continuation -%}
Use a virtual environment and ensure that a `requirements.txt` is present with any dependencies you need to solve the problem.
{% else -%}
Keep using the same virtual environment you started with, update `requirements.txt` with any new dependencies you need.
{% endif -%}

Your task is:
{{ spec.strip() }}
